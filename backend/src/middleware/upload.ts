/** Pushes an in-memory upload straight to Cloudinary — nothing ever
 * touches local disk, so a file survives Render's ephemeral filesystem
 * being wiped on every restart/redeploy (the actual cause of photos that
 * showed as "Approved" but rendered as broken images). Returns the
 * https:// URL Cloudinary serves the image from, which both clients
 * already pass through unchanged (see ApiClient.resolveUrl).
 *
 * Pass `sensitive: true` for anything that shouldn't be a plain,
 * guessable-from-its-path public URL — government ID photos, license
 * photos, and the face-verification selfie, none of which are meant to
 * be viewable by anyone but an admin reviewing them (unlike a profile
 * picture, which the app shows to other users by design). These upload
 * with Cloudinary's `authenticated` delivery type instead of the
 * default `upload` type: the returned URL already carries a real
 * cryptographic signature computed from the account's private secret
 * (confirmed against Cloudinary's own docs and a live test — it's
 * usable immediately, not a placeholder needing a separate signing
 * step), so it can be stored and returned exactly like an ordinary
 * public URL — but unlike one, nobody can construct a working link to
 * it from just the folder/filename the way they could for a plain
 * `upload`-type asset. There's no built-in expiry on this (that needs
 * Cloudinary's token-auth feature, which requires enabling "strict
 * transformations" in the dashboard — not done here); the real
 * protection is that the link isn't derivable without the account's
 * own secret in the first place.
