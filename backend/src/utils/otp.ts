/**
 * Checks [code] for [mobileNumber]/[purpose]. By default this *spends*
 * the code (marks it consumed, so it can't verify again) — pass
 * `consume: false` for an early "is this even right?" check (e.g. an OTP
 * screen's own Verify button) that a later call, like reset-password,
 * still needs to actually spend. Without that distinction, an earlier
 * peek would burn the code and the real, final check would always fail
 * with "invalid or expired" even though the user typed it correctly.
 *
 * `checkExpiry: false` drops the TTL check entirely (the match still has
 * to be an unconsumed code for this number/purpose — just not a
 * time-bounded one). Expiry is meant to bound how long a code sits
 * unused on the OTP screen, not how long someone takes filling in a new
 * password afterward — a call like reset-password, made *after* the
 * code already passed the OTP screen's own (expiry-checked) verify,
 * should pass this flag so a slow typist isn't punished with an
 * "expired" error nowhere near an OTP field to fix it. The code is still
 * single-use and gets invalidated the moment a new one is issued for the
 * same number (see issueOtp), so this doesn't leave it valid forever.
